Using Python and Statistics's Naive Bayes algorithm, building a spam filter for incoming messages. We split the dataset into training and test dataset. Build a vocabulary considering cases like punctuations, letter cases, constants and so on. Determine it's accuracy by making various calculations and build a spam filter for SMS.
